# News-Website

News Website which I made for some revision of the API concepts. I used the News API to get the latest news every hour. The reason why I used only HTML, CSS, and JS is that I wanted to explore the possibilities of these basic languages. It was just for learning and revising the concepts. If I were making a production-level project, then I would be using Next.js with TypeScript for speed and power.

## What I Implemented Using Basic Frontend - HTML, CSS, JS
- Basic authentication using Firebase
- Choose the country for specific country news according to your choice
- Working search bar to search relevant news based on the searched topic
- Using a free API, I generated GNews API Tokens and then used logic to first take a random API and check if data is coming or not. If not, then try another API from the array.

### More to Come Soon
